BTWTweak is a mod that is intended to improve Better Than Wolves mod experience.

Assuming BTWTweak v0.9d and Better Than Wolves 4.99999A0Fb Marsupial!?!?,
(as of 19 Mar 2015) here is the list of changes.


# When launching Minecraft:

- (In some launchers may not work) a no-to-wolf icon for the program

- BTW and BTWTweak versions displayed in the corner of the main menu

- Controls configuration is now a scrollable list, and has a key binding for
  sprinting (default to Left Ctrl).


# In the early game:

- The tree base block is much harder to break, and requires dirt block below it
  to be dug out. Leave it alone. This is to encourage leaving tree stumps so
  deforested areas look awesome. Also a reason to consider planters with grass
  later in game.

- In contrast with the above, spruce and jungle trees are now easier to break.
  This makes softer tree types more suited for crafting, while harder ones are
  best left for fuel.

- Tree trunk tops textures now correspond to the type of the tree instead of
  having oak texture, just like in later Minecraft versions.

- The wooden and stone pickaxes last for 2 and 7 uses respectively, and don't
  immediately expire when you try to attack mobs with them. This makes starting
  (and restarting) just a little bit less tedious, and may prevent death when
  pickaxe is only weapon you have.

- Stone and cobblestone breaks into loose rocks, which can be assembled together
  to make cobblestone slabs and cobblestone blocks. Stone tools are now made
  from loose rocks instead of cobblestone. This makes stone tools a bit cheaper,
  and the first furnace a bit more expensive to craft.

- The furnace now shows whether it is full. Since ores take forever to smelt,
  you probably want lots of furnaces, and now you don't have to click every
  single one to figure out which one has contents.

- When you dig gravel, sometimes you get a loose rock out of it. This makes
  shovel a viable choice for a first tool in order to get your first rocks.

- Flints appear only rarely in place of rocks when digging gravel and stone.
  This makes flint more valuable.

- Eating on the ladder is now dangerous. Don't try shooting with a bow or
  blocking with a sword while on the ladder either. It felt like an exploit
  that you could eat while climbing ladders.

- Gloom has some nice visual effects, so you can be sure it's not that you go
  insane and beat yourself to death in complete darkness. It's something else.

- If you die, a gravestone will be placed nearby, if possible. If you destroy
  it, you only get one rock. This is so you can have memories of your death if
  you manage to find your past gravestone. Mind you, if you oppose this idea,
  you can turn gravestones off by setting their block ID to 0 in BTWTweak.cfg.

- If you play with "short" or "tiny" view distance, you will see the sun and the
  moon, since keeping track of time and moon phases are important parts of the
  gameplay. Fog distance has been pushed back like on "normal" view distance to
  let you see the ghasts that shoot at you in the nether.

- Some convenience crafting recipes, like dirt/sand/gravel slab to piles, two
  cobblestone/stonebrick slabs to full blocks, book from cut tanned leather,
  grinding sandstone back to sand and concentrated hellfire back to dust.

- A bunch of bugfixes. For example, you will no longer die from fall damage when
  docking on a slab in a boat after a long travel. For a complete list of bug
  fixes, check the changelog.


# A bit further to the game:

- Seeds now root themselves when dropped on suitable ground. This makes some
  designs for farm automation possible in the mid game. Make sure not to lose
  your first elusive hemp seeds, though.

- Chickens now drop one more feather on average. This helps reduce their amount
  (and the lag caused) when you decide to breed them for arrows.

- Jack-o-lantern is now placed and dropped just like pumpkins, and if destroyed,
  attempts to place a torch. This is useful for lighting up ravines. Also note
  this replaces any new Jack-o-lantern behavior, such as going off underwater.
  
- Ladder, wooden door, sign and sugar cane no longer stops lava, so do not
  attempt this if you were abusing this before.

- If you are lucky and manage to find a witch hut (and loot it without dying),
  you can use the cistern you find in it to craft a cauldron. Just add a bucket
  of water and a bone on top.

- Cauldron and crucible inventory has been reduced from 27 to 9 slots, and the
  interface now indicates if the fire underneath is stoked. If you want to
  process lots of items, you are encouraged to make automated builds that tilt
  the cauldron/crucible periodically with axle-supplied mechanical power.

- Creepers are now hurt when deoystered. Not so stoic anymore!

- Hand crank bounding box has been lowered to avoid accidental clicking and to
  conform to the shape better.

- Wearing boots now makes you walk faster, but added weight from heavy armor
  slows you down. Consider crafting boots first, it might help you escape death.

- Snow blocks are no longer heat-resistant and will melt in warmer biomes under
  the sun or when placed close enough to any other light source.

- Spider, enderman, zombie pigmen and blazes also have a chance to drop heads.
  Collect them all! Note that spider head is craftable to two spider eyes.

- Renaming items is now possible again, thanks to the new Writing Table block.
  It is crafted with a piece of paper on top of planks. You can even create name
  tags with it to name entities. Named entities will not despawn. You will need
  Ink and Quill, crafted with glass bottle, feather and ink sac; paper,
  and 1 experience level to rename stuff / make name tags.

- Written Book recipe was also changed to require Ink and Quill.

- Block of Padding now reduces fall damage, like a proper soft block.

- Cows and sheep heal when they eat grass. Punch them to teach them a lesson
  every once in a while.

- Silk, crafted from 9 string (and craftable back to string) can be used to
  store spider string in a more compact way.

- Now beds are made with 3 silk on top of 3 padding on top of 3 wooden slabs
  and it's possible to use beds and lie down to rest, and regenerate even when
  hungry. Regeneration rate is doubled and hunger rate is halved when resting.
  Obviously, beds won't skip the night and won't set your spawn point anymore.

- Abandoned mineshafts won't completely replace a need for tree farms anymore.
  The logs in them are eaten by termites and will only drop a piece of sawdust
  when harvested.

- Diamond ingot recipe has been moved to the cauldron. Yep, this requires you to
  burn some wooden logs under the cauldron. This is more fitting for the now
  permanent nature of diamond ingots.

- Logs destroyed by fire now drop ash. Also wither skeletons drop ash. It can be
  used as a fertilizer.


# When you progress to the saw and tanned leather:

- Chest, gearbox, note block, jukebox, door, trapdoor, fence gate, pulley,
  bellows, ladder, bookshelf, hopper, platform, barrel, axle and saw, as well as
  decorative wooden blocks like pedestal, table, bench, column can be sawed
  with a bit of a loss. We all like recycling.

- The saw won't touch pressure plate you put in front of it. It was strange when
  it made it pop out.

- The saw won't break anymore when facing a wool block but will produce wool
  slabs.

- Ladders are now placeable on vertically put sidings, or any suitable surface
  for that matter, not just full blocks.

- Loose rocks can be launched with a dispenser or a sling. The sling is crafted
  with a piece of cut tanned leather and two ropes on sides. Note that the price
  for throwing rocks manually is hunger, and the arc they make is not really
  suitable against the Ghasts.

- Thrown rocks will shatter glass blocks, or if something lands on them from
  a height.

- The turntable doesn't only make smoke and clicks now, it spins visually!

- Hardcore Packing with pistons now applies to loose rocks, which makes
  cobblestone, and ender pearls, which makes ender blocks.

- New enchantment: Velocity. Applied to boots, and each level of it increases
  walking speed by 10%, up to 30%. Ocelots rarely drop Arcane Scrolls of
  Velocity, and also level 1 of that enchantment can be found in trades or made
  in vanilla enchanter.

- Small BTW fixes such as correct soap, rope, padding and wicker block hardness;
  Gloom now consumes player's meat, mycelium and huge mushroom blocks no longer
  show swirling True Sight particles, even though mobs cannot spawn on them.
  

# For when you get access to stoked fire:

- Rails in abandoned mineshafts are rusted and won't give as much of iron
  anymore. If you need lots of iron, you need a mob trap.

- On the other hand, ores are still relevant because cooking them in the Kiln
  doubles the nugget output.

- Potash and ash can be used as a fertilizer for farmland or planter. It can
  simply be dropped on the top of the block, like bonemeal.

- Stoked cauldron can make glue from 8 bones or 24 bone meal.

- Wool blocks can be boiled in a stoked cauldron to retrieve components.

- Piston can be melted down in a stoked crucible to retrieve metallic
  components. More recycling!

- Charcoal texture has been backported the from newer Minecraft versions.


# Late game has only one notable change:

- Cobblestone and stone drop in cobblestone blocks if destroyed by a soulforged
  tool. Like in good old times.


# And finally, some general goodness:

- Pressing the hotbar key of already selected slot will cycle items in the
  corresponding inventory column. This is configurable in BTWTweak.cfg.

- /playtime command that can be used to track the age of the world, and how
  long you've kept being alive

- Sign posts now accept unicode characters

- Improved font display for latin and cyrillic scripts when unicode font
  is chosen. That includes a fix for wider characters.

- Removed the annoying inventory shift when player has effects/buffs.
  It was getting unbearable when running in and outside of a beacon range.
