I'm using now:
162, 163, 164 used


- (from 1.6) named entities display a death message in the chat

- (from 1.8) Backport slime block logic

- (from 1.9) Creepers, skeletons and zombies detection range of a player is halved
  when the player is wearing their corresponding mob head.

- (from 1.9) Transparent water side if behind glass blocks

- (from 1.9) End stone brick

- (from 1.10) Nether wart block?


Straightforward
===============

- Redstone-compliant version of trapdoor (iron trapdoor)

- make spiders explode when they eat infected chickens

- trades account for BTWTweak
  - add silk trade to librarian lvl 2-3?
  - add bed trade to farmer lvl 3-4?
  - add new heads to priest lvl 3
  - move apple for farmer 1-2 lvl higher?

- Make hoppers set soulsand's NBT to souls/XP contained and use that

- Detect transparent texture packs

- display 1 lvl req in rename gui, also prevent network traffic back and forth when typing

- stop knockback is damage received is <= 1

- MultiMine-like mechanics that allow to mine a block faster together
  and continue mining after a short interruption


Need to think more about
========================

- option to make stone and similar hard materials unbreakable by hand

- restore the historical snow layers of varying thickness feature

- port stuff from Unglitch mod

- Make monsters spawn on slabs and animals graze slabs and wolves poop on slabs too

- Block of Padding beacon, with feather falling effect in range

- Make ores drop loose rocks and raw ore pieces; add pure ores
  (block ID so it can be placed in the kiln)

- portals in multiplayer are problematic as opening a portal either means
  uninvited guests, or getting lost as you try to get back


Complex
=======

- Tan leather with salt from water found in seas only, to make an alternative for wolf poo
  Better Than Wolves it is!
  - Gathering water with bucket from sea gives sea water
  - Crafting 3 glass panes in v shape makes a glass pan
  - Glass pan with fire underneath can evaporate sea water to make salt
  - Salt could be used to make food preserved for longer
    - (bacon?) bacon slabs %)

- Hard difficulty: food spoilage
  - each food stack has food spoilage meter that slowly increases on random tick
    - when it reaches 50%, each random tick there's more and more chance for it to rot, with 100% chance on 100% spoilage
    - combining stacks combines food spoilage meter
    - cooking or making new food refreshes spoilage meter
    - food thrown out as an item entity spoils twice faster
    - storing in a chest surrounded by snow or ice blocks makes it spoil 4 times slower

- Some steel-level equipment that protects or cures animals from hell souls?
  - Freezing any living creature, which makes the hell soul escape,
    with ability to unfreeze
    - Needs ice covering all sides and under the influence of potion of weakness to freeze
    - Will damage the entity by half-heart until it has half-heart left, after which it will be frozen
    - Sheep won't freeze/get damaged unless sheared

    - Will implement unfreezing in the following release, to note that cryogenics is one way procedure
    - Death in 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% cases when unfreezing (depending on hellfire beacon level)
    - If was possessed, death in 80%, 70%, 60%, 50% cases when unfreezing (depending on hellfire beacon level)
    - If was a child, death in 100% cases when unfreezing
    - Needs beacon of concentrated hellfire in range and standing on an infernal enchanter to unfreeze
    - If unfrozen by other means (light, lava, etc), 100% death

    - Block dispenser can pick frozen entities up as items

- Allow zombies be cured again, make them convert to villagers that:
  - are dumb and have a funny texture
  - cannot trade
  - if killed, drop same amount of XP as zombie
  - can be bred together to create non-dumb farmer child
  Rationale: apples can be only traded from a village, found in stronhold, or 1 in 100 in a dungeon
  - Also provide steel-tech way to recover other kinds of villagers from those

- Make villagers prioritize often traded materials and demand more of them for 1 emerald or reduce emeralds given;
  similarly, often traded tools from blacksmith rise in prices and so on.
  For a neglected trade, the process should go in reverse.
  - Maximum 4x difference from base price

- Occasional sandstorms in deserts that lower visibility and reduce sand blocks to sand slabs to nothing and fill up space
  with sand slabs and sand slabs to sand blocks


Incomplete
==========

- Slimes absorb all kind of dust/piles, get smaller from that + some effect

- Gearboxes crafted with 6 axles -> gearboxes that can be used in compact designs

- Dirt turning to mud near water or in rain?

- Make skeletons drop bones only when killed by players, and
  bone shards (grindable to 1 bone meal) otherwise, to make glue less easy
  with mob traps.

- Enchant that makes armor level ingot lighter, but leaves at minimum 1 ingot of weight
  - maybe floating sheep could drop it?
  - even crazier: zombie that ate a floating sheep would have a chance to drop that scroll instead of smite
    
- Make endermen conspire against player if he killed too many

- Slimes absorb all kind of dust/piles, get smaller from that + some effect
  - Slimes can merge together to bigger slime


Insignificant
=============
- more uses for nether quartz or black stone

- glistering melon is useless

- if spider web cannot be placed on feet, try block above

- fix axle texture in a better way

- make spiders unable to climb soap blocks

- tooltip icons: info about damage and food value

- make grass block show roots if empty block is directly underneath

- flint tools slightly stronger than rock

- place item frames on floors and maybe on ceilings

- cauldron having a water slot that needs refilling, indicating if the cauldron is dirty;
  dirty needs to be just mined and replaced for now

- lightning striking sand block converts it to fulgurite (glass)
  - but living for a while in desert could lead to too many glass blocks

Oddities:
- white stone & cobble makes 6 stairs instead of usual 4
- nether brick, cobblestone, stone make 6 walls/fences, others make 2
