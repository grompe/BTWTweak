[****** Hacking the source code ******]

Provided you have followed installation instructions and now having
the tweak mod source code in direct form, you can modify it to your taste.

How to convert it back to patch files is your home task.

I like to use git for that, example in _gen_diffs.bat file.

Oh yeah, and for the binary distribution I use bsdiff on original BTWMod.zip and patched
BTWMod.zip, and then the patcher provided here.
