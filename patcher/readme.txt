(Compatible with Better Than Wolves V4.8911+)

[********** Change Log ************]

v0.6

- Fixed packed earth, gravel and sand slab textures broken in v0.5

- BTWTweak.cfg is now automatically created if doesn't exist

- Shift+right-click rocks to quickly convert them to cobblestone

- Support for Six's BTW Research Add-On


v0.5

- Refactoring and a new patching method - hardcore modding!
  Should be compatible with BTW v4.8911 and up

- Because of low profit for amount of effort ratio, and belief that original
  mod author should fix his own bugs, some tweaks were discontinued:
  - Axle seamless texture animation change
  - Bellows, gearbox, pulley, turntable breaking drops fixes
  - Decorative wooden blocks such as pedestal, table, bench, column splitting in saw
  - Arcane scroll not crashing with invalid enchantment
  - Infernal Enchanter exploding instead of crashing with invalid enchantment

- Increased item stay to 30 minutes

- Wool blocks can be sawed to slabs

- Wool blocks can be boiled in a stoked cauldron to retrieve components

- New feature: regenerate stratification

- Fixed (restored) axe effectiveness against Jack-o-lantern

- Fixed gravel filtering randomness in hopper

- Added a recipe to merge 2 stone brick slabs

- Cobblestone and stone drop in block form if destroyed by soulforged tool

- Renamed rotted arrow to rotten arrow to conform with rotten flesh

- Made books craftable with cut tanned leather

- Also note that Jack-o-lantern dropping like pumpkin behavior will replace
  any new Jack-o-lantern behavior, such as going off underwater.


v0.4a

- Updated to BTW v4.891124

- Due to the old patcher and code based on BTW v4.8911,
  some features are not available in this release, and work like in the original BTW:
  - Bellows drops extra tanned leather when overpowered
  - Player still can eat on ladder and armor/boots don't affect movement speed
  - Chicken doesn't drop more feathers
  - Spider doesn't drop head
  - Zombie pigman doesn't drop head
  - Hardcore spawn radius is not configurable in this release


v0.4

- Added loose rocks that come from breaking stone and cobblestone;
  they can be thrown as a basic weapon for the price of making player exhausted;
  cobblestone can be crafted from 2x2 loose rocks and slab from 2 loose rocks

- Changed gravel to give loose rocks and rarely flint when harvested or filtered

- Changed stone to have a rare chance to drop flints

- Let item dispenser throw loose rocks

- Let block dispenser make cobblestone from loose rocks

- Changed stone axe, pickaxe and lever recipes to use loose rocks instead of cobblestone blocks

- Hardcore spawn radius is now configurable; use at your own risk

- Fixed furnace display update when cooked item is taken out

- (not in this release) Raised feather drop from chicken to 1-3 - huge chicken farms aren't hard to make, just laggy and annoying

- Refactored code, smaller patch size

- Updated the patch to BTW v4.891123 but not the patcher or code itself

- Due to the old patcher and code based on BTW v4.8911,
  some features are not available in this release, and work like in the original BTW:
  - Bellows drops extra tanned leather when overpowered
  - Player still can eat on ladder and armor/boots don't affect movement speed
  - Chicken doesn't drop more feathers
  - Spider doesn't drop head
  - Zombie pigman doesn't drop head
