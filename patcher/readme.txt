[********** Change Log ************]

v0.4

- Added loose rocks that come from breaking stone and cobblestone;
  they can be thrown as a basic weapon for the price of making player exhausted;
  cobblestone can be crafted from 2x2 loose rocks and slab from 2 loose rocks

- Changed gravel to give loose rocks and rarely flint when harvested or filtered

- Changed stone to have a rare chance to drop flints

- Let item dispenser throw loose rocks

- Hardcore spawn radius is now configurable; use at your own risk

- Fixed furnace display update when cooked item is taken out

- (not in this release) Raised feather drop from chicken to 1-3 - huge chicken farms aren't hard to make, just laggy and annoying

- Refactored code, smaller patch size

- Updated the patch to BTW v4.891123 but not the patcher or code itself

- Due to the old patcher and code based on BTW v4.8911,
