Main goals
==========
- Fix up rough edges of BTW
- Provide an alternative way of accomplishing things
  (ex. punching wood vs. finding flint, tanning with poo vs. salt, etc.)
- Keep the balance


Completed
=========

- Furnace progress is reset when item currently processing is replaced

- Cauldron, crucible have 9 slot inventory and indicate if the fire is stoked

- Jack-o-lantern is placed, pushed by pistons and dropped just like pumpkins,
  and if destroyed, tries to place a torch

- Add missing high efficiency recipe for Nether Quartz stairs (removed as exists in BTW v4.891)

- Dirt slab craftable to 2 dirt piles

- Ladder, wooden door, sign and sugar cane no longer stops lava

- Saw won't touch pressure plates

- Chest, gearbox, note block, jukebox, door, trapdoor, fence gate, pulley,
  bellows, ladder, table, pedestal, column, bench, bookshelf, hopper,
  platform, barrel, axle and saw itself can be sawed with a bit of loss

- Cauldron GUI fire is below the inventory slots

- Chance to drop flint when gravel is broken to piles

- Eating lets go off ladder

- Walking is faster with boots but slower with heavy armor

- Stoked cauldron can make glue from 8 bones or 24 bone meal

- Allow potash as farmland or planter fertilizer

- Ladders placeable on sidings

- Snow blocks are no longer heat-resistant

- Renamed shafts to rods just for the hell of it

- Gearbox and pulley drop redstone latch instead of redstone dust when overpowered

- Bellows no longer joins tanned leather when overpowered

- Turntable drops clock instead of redstone when overpowered

- Lower hand crank clickable height

- Fixed soap, rope, padding and wicker block hardness

- Using invalid scrolls results in an explosion rather than crash

- Creeper is hurt when deoystered

- Seamless powered axle animated texture

- Block of Padding reduces fall damage

- Furnace shows whether it has contents

- Gravel and sand slabs

- Add spider, enderman, zombie pig, blaze heads


Skipped
=======

- Cauldron, mill stone progress reset when item currently processing is replaced
  (too complex for its worth)

- Disallow eating while breaking blocks
  (too rare to be abused)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Straightforward
===============

- Make screams from cake, grinding netherrack, etc. scare away animals

- Make consuming by darkness actually consume the meat, complete with a burp


Needs more thought on implementation
====================================

- Cauldron having a water slot that needs refilling, indicating if the cauldron is dirty;
  dirty needs to be just mined and replaced for now

- Non-awkward placing of sidings and mouldings or at least a preview shadow;
  also let them fill the block up to next appropriate state: mouldings, sidings, stairs, planks, etc.
  - For example, always place things vertically and when crouching - horizontally.
  - Also let the player occupy part of the block he intends to build in if it doesn't intersect the bounding box
  - look at FCBlockMoulding.java / onBlockPlaced()

- Burned wood makes ash piles (like snow layers)
  - Use ash as fertilizer

- Make turntable top texture animated when it's working

- Make animals affected by gloom as well, to make encasing them to save from danger more difficult

- Make darker stone drop darker version of cobble, allow crafting from it like regular stone/cobble
  with exception of bricks: they will have darker texture; sidings, mouldings and such with it

- On respawn, if not affected by Hardcore Spawn, reduce the health and hunger to 50%

- Gravestones on death (only if next respawn is affected by hardcore spawn)

- Beds are made with blocks of padding instead of wool and lying in them doesn't skip time,
  just changes the camera position, makes hunger go twice slower and regeneration twice faster.


Needs more thought on balance or fitting in
===========================================

- Iron and gold ores giving nuggets via furnace and ingots via kiln

- Redstone-compliant version of trapdoor (iron trapdoor)

- Make diamond ingots in a cauldron instead
  (study gameplay balance change: will force player either to burn planks/logs under the cauldron,
   or create nether portal in the lava pool)
  - need to keep cauldron progress for a few seconds without the fire

- Abandoned mineshaft wood is mostly eaten by termites, is slightly easier to break and will give
  only sawdust and bark on destruction, regardless of methods, will break if pushed by a piston
  - Requires a new block ID, or hack into planks unused metadata


Fleshing out
============

- Get rid of punching wood, wooden pickaxe, use flints on stone to craft rough stone tools

- Tan leather with salt from water found in seas only, to make an alternative for wolf poo
  Better Than Wolves it is!
  - Evaporating sea water to gain salt would require finite water
  - Salt could be used to make food tastier (bacon?)

- Gearboxes crafted with 6 axles -> gearboxes that can be used in compact designs

- Do something with wooden and stone slabs against easy hand crafting
