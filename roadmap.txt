Main goals
==========
- Fix up rough edges of BTW
- Provide an alternative way of accomplishing things
- Keep the balance


Skipped
=======

- Make animals affected by gloom as well, to make encasing them to save from danger more difficult
- Light blocks drop filament and redstone when broken
  (thought against it)
- Prevent weapons from decreasing durability if no damage was done (clicked a red mob)
  or reduce red time (might have side-effects)
- On respawn, if not affected by Hardcore Spawn, reduce the health and hunger to 50%


Feedback
========

- glue from bones was removed for a good reason: you're swimming in mob drops once you have a mob farm
  [Grom] My experience is that mob farm is sufficiently late-game to allow infinite glue, so I'm keeping it


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Cauldron having a water slot that needs refilling, indicating if the cauldron is dirty;
  dirty needs to be just mined and replaced for now

- Better way of placing sidings and mouldings: let them fill the block up to next appropriate state:
  mouldings, sidings, stairs, planks, etc.
  - For example, always place things vertically and when crouching - horizontally.
  - look at FCBlockMoulding.java / onBlockPlaced()

- Fix axle texture in a better way

- Port MultiMine

- Lightning striking sand block converts it to fulgurite (glass)
  - but living for a while in desert could lead to too many glass blocks

- Block of Padding beacon, with feather falling effect in range

- Make endermen conspire against player if he killed too many


Demands Block IDs
=================

- Backport slime block logic

- Redstone-compliant version of trapdoor (iron trapdoor)

- Dirt turning to mud near water or in rain?

- Make ores drop loose rocks and raw ore pieces; add pure ores
  (block ID so it can be placed in the kiln)


Fleshing out
============

- Tan leather with salt from water found in seas only, to make an alternative for wolf poo
  Better Than Wolves it is!
  - Gathering water with bucket from sea gives sea water
  - Crafting 3 glass panes in v shape makes a glass pan
  - Glass pan with fire underneath can evaporate sea water to make salt
  - Salt could be used to make food preserved for longer
    - (bacon?) bacon slabs %)

- Hard difficulty: food spoilage
  - each food stack has food spoilage meter that slowly increases on random tick
    - when it reaches 50%, each random tick there's more and more chance for it to rot, with 100% chance on 100% spoilage
    - combining stacks combines food spoilage meter
    - cooking or making new food refreshes spoilage meter
    - food thrown out as an item entity spoils twice faster
    - storing in a chest surrounded by snow or ice blocks makes it spoil 4 times slower

- Occasional sandstorms in deserts that lower visibility and reduce sand blocks to sand slabs to nothing and fill up space
  with sand slabs and sand slabs to sand blocks

- Gearboxes crafted with 6 axles -> gearboxes that can be used in compact designs

- More uses for nether quartz or black stone


Random info
===========

Oddities:
- white stone & cobble makes 6 stairs instead of usual 4
