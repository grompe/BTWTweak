Main goals
==========
- Fix up rough edges of BTW
- Provide an alternative way of accomplishing things
- Keep the balance


Completed
=========

- Furnace progress is reset when item currently processing is replaced

- Cauldron, crucible have 9 slot inventory and indicate if the fire is stoked

- Jack-o-lantern is placed, pushed by pistons and dropped just like pumpkins,
  and if destroyed, tries to place a torch

- Add missing high efficiency recipe for Nether Quartz stairs (removed as exists in BTW v4.891)

- Dirt slab craftable to 2 dirt piles

- Ladder, wooden door, sign and sugar cane no longer stops lava

- Saw won't touch pressure plates

- Chest, gearbox, note block, jukebox, door, trapdoor, fence gate, pulley,
  bellows, ladder, table, pedestal, column, bench, bookshelf, hopper,
  platform, barrel, axle and saw itself can be sawed with a bit of loss

- Cauldron GUI fire is below the inventory slots

- Chance to drop flint when gravel is broken to piles

- Eating lets go off ladder

- Walking is faster with boots but slower with heavy armor

- Stoked cauldron can make glue from 8 bones or 24 bone meal

- Allow potash as farmland or planter fertilizer

- Ladders placeable on sidings

- Snow blocks are no longer heat-resistant

- Renamed shafts to rods just for the hell of it

- Gearbox and pulley drop redstone latch instead of redstone dust when overpowered

- Bellows no longer joins tanned leather when overpowered

- Turntable drops clock instead of redstone when overpowered

- Lower hand crank clickable height

- Fixed soap, rope, padding and wicker block hardness

- Using invalid scrolls results in an explosion rather than crash

- Creeper is hurt when deoystered

- Seamless powered axle animated texture

- Block of Padding reduces fall damage

- Furnace shows whether it has contents

- Gravel and sand slabs

- Add spider, enderman, zombie pig, blaze heads


v0.4:

- Cleanup code and separate what can be separated

- Change stone and cobblestone break to loose rocks (that can be recrafted to cobblestone)

- Change axe, pickaxe, shovel, lever recipes to require loose rocks

- Rocks can be thrown for damage and will exhaust the user; they are also usable in dispensers

- Flint is a rare drop from both stone and filtering gravel; gravel usually gives loose rocks

- Hardcore spawn radius is now configurable; use at your own risk

- Raised feather drop from chicken to 1-3 - huge chicken farms aren't hard to make, just laggy and annoying


Skipped
=======

- Cauldron, mill stone progress reset when item currently processing is replaced
  (too complex for its worth)

- Disallow eating while breaking blocks
  (too rare to be abused)

- Make darker stone drop darker version of cobble, allow crafting from it like regular stone/cobble
  with exception of bricks: they will have darker texture; sidings, mouldings and such with it
  (addition of loose rocks is incompatible)

- Get rid of punching wood, wooden pickaxe, use flints on stone to craft rough stone tools
  (addition of loose rocks made such change less meaningful)


Feedback
========

- glue from bones was removed for a good reason: you're swimming in mob drops once you have a mob farm


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Straightforward
===============

- Make screams from cake, grinding netherrack, etc. scare away animals

- Make consuming by darkness actually consume the meat, complete with a burp

- Craft books with cut tanned leather

- Display world time converted to real time of current world played

- Light blocks drop filament and redstone when broken

- Prevent weapons from decreasing durability if no damage was done (clicked a red mob)
  or reduce red time


Needs more thought on implementation
====================================

- Make ores drop loose rocks and raw ore pieces; add pure ores

- Port lava fix from MC 1.6

- Cauldron having a water slot that needs refilling, indicating if the cauldron is dirty;
  dirty needs to be just mined and replaced for now

- Non-awkward placing of sidings and mouldings or at least a preview shadow;
  also let them fill the block up to next appropriate state: mouldings, sidings, stairs, planks, etc.
  - For example, always place things vertically and when crouching - horizontally.
  - Also let the player occupy part of the block he intends to build in if it doesn't intersect the bounding box
  - look at FCBlockMoulding.java / onBlockPlaced()

- Burned wood makes ash piles (like snow layers)
  - Use ash as fertilizer

- Make turntable top texture animated when it's working

- Make animals affected by gloom as well, to make encasing them to save from danger more difficult

- On respawn, if not affected by Hardcore Spawn, reduce the health and hunger to 50%

- Gravestones on death (only if next respawn is affected by hardcore spawn)

- Beds are made with blocks of padding instead of wool and lying in them doesn't skip time,
  just changes the camera position, makes hunger go twice slower and regeneration twice faster.


Needs more thought on balance or fitting in
===========================================

- Shave chickens with shears for fun and slight increase in feathers compared to killing; they won't regrow it

- Iron and gold ores giving nuggets via furnace and ingots via kiln

- Redstone-compliant version of trapdoor (iron trapdoor)

- Make diamond ingots in a cauldron instead
  (study gameplay balance change: will force player either to burn planks/logs under the cauldron,
   or create nether portal in the lava pool)
  - need to keep cauldron progress for a few seconds without the fire

- Abandoned mineshaft wood is mostly eaten by termites, is slightly easier to break and will give
  only sawdust and bark on destruction, regardless of methods, will break if pushed by a piston
  - Requires a new block ID, or hack into planks unused metadata


Fleshing out
============

- Tan leather with salt from water found in seas only, to make an alternative for wolf poo
  Better Than Wolves it is!
  - Evaporating sea water to gain salt would require finite water
  - Salt could be used to make food tastier (bacon?)
    - bacon slabs %)

- Gearboxes crafted with 6 axles -> gearboxes that can be used in compact designs

- Do something with wooden and stone slabs against easy hand crafting
