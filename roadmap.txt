Main goals
==========
- Fix up rough edges of BTW
- Provide an alternative way of accomplishing things
- Keep the balance


Skipped
=======

- Make darker stone drop darker version of cobble, allow crafting from it like regular stone/cobble
  with exception of bricks: they will have darker texture; sidings, mouldings and such with it
  (addition of loose rocks is incompatible)

- Get rid of punching wood, wooden pickaxe, use flints on stone to craft rough stone tools
  (addition of loose rocks made such change less meaningful)

- Make screams from cake, grinding netherrack, etc. scare away animals
  (code is too tangled for the worth of this effect)


Feedback
========

- glue from bones was removed for a good reason: you're swimming in mob drops once you have a mob farm
  [Grom] My experience is that mob farm is sufficiently late-game to allow infinite glue, so I'm keeping it


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Straightforward
===============

- Make consuming by darkness actually consume the meat, complete with a burp

- Light blocks drop filament and redstone when broken

- Prevent weapons from decreasing durability if no damage was done (clicked a red mob)
  or reduce red time (might have side-effects)

- Break glass and glass panes when landed on them from a height


Needs more thought on implementation
====================================

- Make ores drop loose rocks and raw ore pieces; add pure ores

- Cauldron having a water slot that needs refilling, indicating if the cauldron is dirty;
  dirty needs to be just mined and replaced for now

- Non-awkward placing of sidings and mouldings or at least a preview shadow;
  also let them fill the block up to next appropriate state: mouldings, sidings, stairs, planks, etc.
  - For example, always place things vertically and when crouching - horizontally.
  - Also let the player occupy part of the block he intends to build in if it doesn't intersect the bounding box
  - look at FCBlockMoulding.java / onBlockPlaced()

- Burned wood makes ash piles (like snow layers)
  - Use ash as fertilizer

- Make turntable top texture animated when it's working

- Make animals affected by gloom as well, to make encasing them to save from danger more difficult

- On respawn, if not affected by Hardcore Spawn, reduce the health and hunger to 50%

- Gravestones on death (only if next respawn is affected by hardcore spawn)

- Better fishing rods made with soulforged steel nugget

- Fix axle texture in a better way


Needs more thought on balance or fitting in
===========================================

- Speed enchantment for boots, scroll rare drop from cats (ocelots)!

- Shave chickens with shears for fun and slight increase in feathers compared to killing; they won't regrow it

- Redstone-compliant version of trapdoor (iron trapdoor)

- Abandoned mineshaft wood is mostly eaten by termites, is slightly easier to break and will give
  only sawdust and bark on destruction, regardless of methods, will break if pushed by a piston
  - Requires a new block ID, or hack into planks unused metadata


Fleshing out
============

- Tan leather with salt from water found in seas only, to make an alternative for wolf poo
  Better Than Wolves it is!
  - Evaporating sea water to gain salt would require finite water
    or a special construct to fill with water
  - Salt could be used to make food tastier (bacon?)
    - bacon slabs %)

- Hard difficulty: food spoilage
  - each food stack has food spoilage meter that slowly increases on random tick
    - when it reaches 50%, each random tick there's more and more chance for it to rot, with 100% chance on 100% spoilage
    - combining stacks combines food spoilage meter
    - cooking or making new food refreshes spoilage meter
    - food thrown out as an item entity spoils twice faster
    - storing in a chest surrounded by snow or ice blocks makes it spoil 4 times slower

- Occasional sandstorms in deserts that lower visibility and reduce sand blocks to sand slabs to nothing and fill up space
  with sand slabs and sand slabs to sand blocks

- Gearboxes crafted with 6 axles -> gearboxes that can be used in compact designs

- More uses for rope, creeper oysters(?: bait is maybe good enough), sugar


Random info
===========

Oddities:
- white stone & cobble makes 6 stairs instead of usual 4
